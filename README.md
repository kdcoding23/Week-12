Promineo Tech's Week 12 assignment was to create a full CRUD application that meet these criteria:

- Use a form to add new entities
- Build a way for users to update or delete entities
- Use Bootstrap and CSS to style your project

Using Mock API, I created a "Book Club" app that allows users to add and update the titles, authors, and genres of books that they would like to read (and delete each book when they're done reading it).
